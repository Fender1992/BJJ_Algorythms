            Well, everyone really. We made this site for beginners all the way to expert. What me and my friend realized while training is the barrier for white belts all the way to purple is the inability to chain moves in rapid succession. This is not an end all be all to training but it will give you, the parctitioner, the ability to quickly develope your own game using a series of moves. Additionally, if you are an instructor you can use this as a guide for teaching your students and maybe break up the repetitiveness of classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a parctitioner and would like to add to this feel free to email myself, Rolando Fender, or Jon Jordan and we will do our best add your suggestions.
